# Privacy Friendly Notes

This app lets you create and manage notes. Currently it supports four types of notes:
- Text 
- Checklist
- Audio
- Sketch

All of them can be saved on the internal storage or shared with other apps. You can also assign categories.<br />

This app belongs to the group of Privacy Friendly Apps developed by Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. <br />

## Motivation

Most apps for note taking need a lot of permissions and synchronize over the internet. Consequently they use some company service, that you have to trust. While this is a convenient feature, it weakens your privacy.<br />


## Building

Further development requires Android Studio, we recommend to use the latest version.
